# MADS Program Chat Assistant

A chatbot that answers questions about the Master of Applied Data Science program.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Preprocess the data (only needs to be done once):
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
- Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted
- This will create a `processed_data` directory with the embeddings

4. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## File Structure
```
